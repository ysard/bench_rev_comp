hash : This algorithme is based on hashmap associat A -> T, T -> A, C -> G, G -> C.


tab : This algorithme is based on char tabluar with 85 (T char value + 1) case and associated A -> T, T -> A, C -> G, G -> C.

pol3 : This algoritme is based one a third degree polynomial obtaine by lagrange interpolation.

naive : Just some if else
